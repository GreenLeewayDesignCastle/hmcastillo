                      Features for a project can be very broad or very specific.
                      Together with the client I develop the application step by step to make
                      their concept into reality.

                      After the most important features have been chosen I design the user interface and present it, the client
                      can have a feel of the website and small changes are made till it's fully done to be coded

                     Here I convert the design into code and actually bring the idea of the client to reality.

                     After having tested the first version of the prototype carefully and having made the last changes, the deployment
